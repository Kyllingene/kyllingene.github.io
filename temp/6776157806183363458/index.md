# Hi! I'm Kyllingene.

I have opinions. Opinions are important, so I decided to share mine with
you!

## `whoami`?

I'm (currently) a student who programs as a hobby. I'm not that great, but I do
it a lot, so I know some things.

I mostly focus on systems programming in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), but I occasionally dabble in
other fields (like this website).

## So what's this?

This is where I plan to host any content I put forth in the future. I may
eventually migrate to become self-hosted, but that costs money and time and this
is a test anyways.

## Look at my stuff!

You probably want some links to click, so here's a few:

- [Why Open Source Matters](./essays/why-open-source-matters.html) - an essay on the importance of FOSS software
- *TODO* [State Of the Internet Address]() - an essay on the poor state of the Internet
- [My Github](https://github.com/Kyllingene) (on which this is hosted)

## Contact

I try to stay on the right side of the law, but in case you need to contact me,
my email is [fuzzymuffin343@gmail.com](mailto:fuzzymuffin343@gmail.com). I
should respond fairly quickly, but don't fear to send multiple emails if you
really need to get my attention.
