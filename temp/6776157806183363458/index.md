# Hi! I'm Kyllingene

I have opinions. Opinions are important, so I decided to share mine with
you!

## `whoami`?

I'm (currently) a student who programs as a hobby. I'm not that great, but I do
it a lot, so I know some things.

I mostly focus on systems programming in [Rust][1], but I
occasionally dabble in other fields (like this website).

## So what's this?

This is where I plan to host any content I put forth in the future. I may
eventually migrate to become self-hosted, but that costs money and time and
this is a test anyways.

## Look at my stuff!

You probably want some links to click, so here's a few:

- [My Github][2] (on which this is hosted)

### Essays

- [Why Open Source Matters][3] - an essay on the importance of FOSS software
<!-- - *TODO* [State Of the Internet Address]() - an essay on the poor state of the Internet -->

### Projects

*Note:* these are (probably) all in Rust (if applicable); however, some of them
may be executables, so non-Rustaceans can appreciate them too:

- [`sarge`][4] - A light but ergonomic CLI args parsing library
- [`timepiece`][6] - A command-line all-purpose timepiece
- [`rssg`][5] - An indev static-site generator - used for this site!

## Contact

I try to stay on the right side of the law. But in case you need to contact me,
my email is [fuzzymuffin343@gmail.com](mailto:fuzzymuffin343@gmail.com). I
should respond fairly quickly, but don't fear to send multiple emails if you
really need to get my attention.
