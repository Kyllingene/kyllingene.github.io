            <h1 id="hiimkyllingene">Hi! I&#8217;m Kyllingene</h1>

<p>I have opinions. Opinions are important, so I decided to share mine with
you!</p>

<h2 id="whoami"><code>whoami</code>?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m (currently) a student who programs as a hobby. I&#8217;m not that great, but I do
it a lot, so I know some things.</p>

<p>I mostly focus on systems programming in <a href="&lt;https://rust-lang.org&gt;">Rust</a>, but I
occasionally dabble in other fields (like this website).</p>

<h2 id="sowhatsthis">So what&#8217;s this?</h2>

<p>This is where I plan to host any content I put forth in the future. I may
eventually migrate to become self-hosted, but that costs money and time and
this is a test anyways.</p>

<h2 id="lookatmystuff">Look at my stuff!</h2>

<p>You probably want some links to click, so here&#8217;s a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="&lt;https://github.com/Kyllingene&gt;">My Github</a> (on which this is hosted)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="essays">Essays</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="&lt;./essays/why-open-source-matters.html&gt;">Why Open Source Matters</a> - an essay on the importance of FOSS software
<!-- - *TODO* [State Of the Internet Address]() - an essay on the poor state of the Internet --></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<p><em>Note:</em> these are (probably) all in Rust (if applicable); however, some of them
may be executables, so non-Rustaceans can appreciate them too:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="&lt;https://crates.io/crates/sarge&gt;"><code>sarge</code></a> - A light but ergonomic CLI args parsing library</li>
<li><a href="&lt;https://crates.io/crates/timepiece&gt;"><code>timepiece</code></a> - A command-line all-purpose timepiece</li>
<li><a href="&lt;https://crates.io/crates/rssg&gt;"><code>rssg</code></a> - An indev static-site generator - used for this site!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>I try to stay on the right side of the law. But in case you need to contact me,
my email is <a href="mailto:fuzzymuffin343@gmail.com">fuzzymuffin343@gmail.com</a>. I
should respond fairly quickly, but don&#8217;t fear to send multiple emails if you
really need to get my attention.</p>
